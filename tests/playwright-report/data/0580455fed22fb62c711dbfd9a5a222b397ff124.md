              - generic [ref=e105]: To ensure your solar energy system is a perfect match for your unique energy goals, we take a highly personalised approach. Our process begins with an in-depth face-to-face consultation to understand your energy usage patterns, environmental goals, and budget considerations. From there, our expert surveyors/designers conduct a thorough site assessment, analysing factors like roof orientation, shading, sunlight, cable runs and location of inverters and batteries to determine the optimal system design. Using cutting-edge technology and high-quality products, we then design a customised solution that maximises energy efficiency and cost savings. Finally, our skilled in-house technicians handle the entire installation process with precision, ensuring that your system is ready to perform reliably and efficiently for years to come.

              - generic [ref=e107]: Once your system is up and running, our commitment continues with comprehensive in-person aftercare appointment, app training and ongoing system monitoring. Through an intuitive app, you can track and understand your energy production. We also include a 5-year insurance-backed guarantee for your extra peace of mind, ensuring that your investment is fully protected. Throughout the entire process, we stay in close communication so you feel informed and confident at every step of your solar journey and long into the future.
